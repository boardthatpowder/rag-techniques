    "# Routing: Logical\n",
    "\n",
    "![logical routing](../images/images-logical.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical Routing** is a technique to direct queries to the most suitable data source or system based on predefined rules or conditions. It relies on **explicit criteria**, like keywords, query patterns, or metadata, to decide where a query should go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem Logical Routing Solves\n",
    "Not all queries are the same, and different types of questions may require information from different sources. Logical routing ensures that:\n",
    "- Queries are handled by the most relevant system or data source.\n",
    "- Simple rules can efficiently filter and guide queries without needing complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Logical Routing Works\n",
    "1. **Define Rules**:\n",
    "   - Rules are set up in advance to match specific query features to a corresponding destination.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - Queries containing the word \"Python\" go to a database on programming languages.\n",
    "     - Queries asking about \"health\" go to a medical knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate the Query**:\n",
    "   - The system analyzes the query based on the predefined rules.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - Rule: \"If the query contains the keyword 'tax,' route it to the financial data source.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Route the Query**:\n",
    "   - Based on the rule evaluation, the query is sent to the appropriate data source or processing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "#### Query:\n",
    "*\"What are the top frameworks for Python development?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical Routing:\n",
    "1. **Keyword Detection**:\n",
    "   - The rule detects the keyword \"Python.\"\n",
    "2. **Apply Rule**:\n",
    "   - Match: \"Route to the programming frameworks database.\"\n",
    "3. **Retrieve and Respond**:\n",
    "   - The system retrieves relevant Python frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Logical Routing Works\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Simple rules process queries quickly without the need for heavy computation.\n",
    "- **Clarity**: The rules are explicit and easy to understand or modify.\n",
    "- **Effectiveness**: Works well when query intent is clear and matches predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Logical Routing\n",
    "- **Keyword Matching**: Direct routing based on specific words or phrases in the query.\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: Use of patterns like question formats (e.g., \"What is...\" or \"How to...\").\n",
    "- **Metadata Analysis**: Routing based on additional query data like user preferences or query source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "In a customer support system:\n",
    "- **Rule 1**: Queries with the keyword \"billing\" are routed to the finance team.\n",
    "- **Rule 2**: Queries with \"password reset\" go to the IT support database.\n",
    "- **Rule 3**: Queries mentioning \"shipping\" are directed to the logistics department.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Logical Routing\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and maintain.\n",
    "- **Speed**: No need for complex models or processing steps.\n",
    "- **Predictability**: The routing behavior is transparent and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, **Logical Routing** is like a decision tree for queries: if a query fits a certain rule, it’s sent down the right path. It’s simple, fast, and works well when the rules are clear and the query categories are well-defined!\n",
