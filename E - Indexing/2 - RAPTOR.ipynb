    "# Indexing: RAPTOR (Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval)\n",
    "\n",
    "![raptor](../images/images-RAPTOR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAPTOR** is an advanced method designed to enhance how AI systems retrieve and process information, especially from large and complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How RAPTOR Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Segmentation:**\n",
    "   - Large documents are divided into smaller, manageable chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding and Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Each chunk is converted into a numerical representation (embedding) that captures its meaning.\n",
    "   - Chunks with similar content are grouped together using clustering algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summarization:**\n",
    "   - For each cluster, a concise summary is generated that encapsulates the main ideas of the grouped chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursive Processing:**\n",
    "   - The summarization and clustering process is repeated on the summaries, creating higher-level summaries.\n",
    "   - This recursive approach builds a hierarchical tree structure, with detailed information at the bottom and broader summaries at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Information Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - When a user poses a query, the system navigates this tree structure to find the most relevant information.\n",
    "   - It can access different levels of detail, depending on the complexity of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of RAPTOR:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Retrieval:** The hierarchical structure allows the system to quickly locate relevant information without scanning the entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Understanding:** By accessing summaries at various levels, the system can provide answers that consider both detailed and general aspects of a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:** RAPTOR is effective for large datasets, making it suitable for applications involving extensive documents or collections of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in Practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a lengthy research paper and you want to find information about a specific concept discussed within it. Using RAPTOR, the system can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quickly navigate through the hierarchical summaries to locate the section where the concept is discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide you with a concise summary of that section, or delve deeper into the specific details, depending on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that you receive accurate and contextually relevant information without having to read through the entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed understanding, you can refer to the original research paper on RAPTOR: \n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing RAPTOR, AI systems can significantly improve their ability to process and retrieve information from complex and extensive documents, leading to more accurate and efficient responses. \n",
