Based on the Q+A pairs provided, I can synthesize that LLM-powered autonomous agent systems have several main components:

1. Core Controller/Brain: The LLM itself serves as the central controller, providing more flexible and general problem-solving capabilities compared to traditional rule-based systems.

2. Planning and Reasoning Modules: These can be implemented in different ways:
- ReAct approach: Integrates reasoning and acting through combined task-specific actions and language-based reasoning
- LLM+P approach: Uses external classical planners with PDDL for long-horizon planning

3. Memory Systems: While specific details aren't provided, memory is mentioned as a key component of these systems.

4. Task Management: The system can break down complex tasks into subgoals and includes capabilities for self-reflection and learning from mistakes.

However, it's worth noting that some aspects, such as specific details about memory systems and input/output handling, are not fully detailed in the source material. The architecture appears to be built around the LLM as the core component, with supporting systems for planning, reasoning, and memory management to enable autonomous operation.
