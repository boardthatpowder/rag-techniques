Based on the context, the main components of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system include: 1) Planning (which involves subgoal decomposition and reflection/refinement), 2) Memory (with retrieval models that consider relevance, recency, and importance), and 3) LLM as the core controller or "brain" of the system. These components work together to enable the agent to break down tasks, learn from past experiences, and make informed decisions.
