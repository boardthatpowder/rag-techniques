Based on the provided context, an LLM-powered autonomous agent system has the following main components:

1. LLM as the Core Controller (Brain)
- Functions as the central processing unit or "brain" of the agent system
- Goes beyond basic text generation to serve as a general problem solver

2. Planning Component
This includes two key aspects:
- Subgoal and decomposition
  * Breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals
  * Enables efficient handling of complex tasks
- Reflection and refinement
  * Allows for self-criticism and self-reflection on past actions
  * Learns from mistakes
  * Refines actions for future steps
  * Improves the quality of final results

3. Memory Component
While the specific details of the memory component aren't elaborated in the given context, it is mentioned as one of the key components of the system.

The context also mentions examples of such systems like AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer, and BabyAGI as proof-of-concept demonstrations, with AutoGPT being highlighted as having a natural language interface, though with some reliability issues.

These components work together to create an autonomous system that can understand, plan, remember, and execute tasks while learning from its experiences.
