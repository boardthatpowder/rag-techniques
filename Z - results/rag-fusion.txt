Based on the context, a LLM-powered autonomous agent system consists of three main components: (1) LLM as the core controller or "brain," (2) Planning capabilities, which include subgoal decomposition and reflection/refinement mechanisms, and (3) Memory systems. The LLM functions as the primary decision-maker while planning helps break down complex tasks and memory enables the system to retain and learn from past experiences.
